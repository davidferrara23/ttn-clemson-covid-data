# Clemson COVID-19 Data Repository

This repository is a collection of COVID-19 data for Clemson University and the surrounding Clemson, South Carolina area, gathered and organized by [The Tiger News](http://www.thetigercu.com) for transparency and publication amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The information is both historical and updated whenever possible, such as when the university's COVID-19 dashboard is updated each Tuesday and Friday end-of-day.

The data is actively being used by The Tiger News for analysis and reporting updates to the Clemson community. In addition, the data is being published in-part on The Tiger News's COVID-19 dashboard, viewable on our homepage.

## Sources

University data is sourced primarily from the Clemson University administration, including publicly released data on the university's [COVID-19 dashboard](https://www.clemson.edu/covid-19/testing/dashboard.html) as well as data obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by The Tiger News.

Data for South Carolina is sourced from the [COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/data/state/south-carolina#summary-charts). Specific county-level data such as that for Pickens, Anderson, and Oconee counties is sourced directly from [SCDHEC](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/south-carolina-county-level-data-covid-19).

Other sources are cited when appropriate.

Whenever possible, information provided by the university is given precedent and if an alternative source provides drastically different information, both are provided. The county data does not remove Clemson positive cases from the counts, as there is no feasible way to make this distinction with the information available.
